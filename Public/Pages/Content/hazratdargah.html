    <h2> Architecture </h2>
    <hr>
    The tombs of Amir Khusrau, Nizamuddin's disciple, and Jehan Ara Begum, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan">Shah Jahan</a>'s daughter, are located at the entrance to the complex. Ziauddin Barani and Muhammad Shah are also buried here. Overall, the dargah complex has more than 70 graves.
    The complex was renovated and restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture around 2010.
    <h3> Dargah </h3>
    <p>
        Nizamuddin's tomb has a white dome. The main structure was built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Tughluq">Muhammad bin Tughluq</a> in 1325, following Nizamuddin's death. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firuz_Shah_Tughlaq">Firuz Shah Tughlaq</a> later repaired the structure and suspended four golden cups from the dome's recesses. Nawab Khurshid Jah of Hyderabad’s legendary Paigah Family gifted the marble balustrade that surrounds the grave. The present dome was built by Faridun Khan in 1562. The structure underwent many additions over the years.[9] The dome is about six metres in diameter.

    <h2> Location </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The neighborhood surrounding the dargah, Nizamuddin Basti, is named after the saint. The area was initially the site of the settlement of Ghiyaspur, where Nizamuddin lived, and was later named after him. The Basti's population mainly grew after refugees settled here during the Partition of India. Prior to that, the area was mainly occupied only by the pirzade, the direct descendants of Nizamuddin.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Basti area has small lodges, small eateries and shops selling elements related to Islamic culture, such as religious books, kurtas, skull caps and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ittar">ittar</a> (transl. perfumes). It also has butcher shops.
    </p>
    <h2> Culture </h2>

    <p>
        The area is referred to as the "nerve centre of Sufi culture in India". On the 17th and 18th day of the Islamic month of Rabi' al-awwal, thousands gather to observe the birth anniversary and urs (death anniversary) of the saint. Besides this, thousands also visit on the birth and death anniversaries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, Nizamuddin's disciple. Hundreds visit the dargah everyday throughout the year to pray and pay their respects. The dargah has a tradition of qawwali, especially the one on every Thursday night attracting about 1500 visitors. The regular qawwalis occur every evening after the Maghrib prayer. The dargah has multiple intergenerational darbari qawwals. Women are traditionally not allowed inside the dargah’s inner sanctum. Besides this, the dargah organizes a daily langar.
