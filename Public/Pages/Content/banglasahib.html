    Gurdwara Bangla Sahib was originally a bungalow belonging to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Singh_I">Raja Jai Singh</a>, a Hindu Rajput ruler in the seventeenth century, and was known as Jaisinghpura Palace, in Jaisingh Pura, an historic neighbourhood demolished to make way for the Connaught Place, shopping district. Since Guru Har Kishan stayed at Raja Jai Singh's Banglow (pronouned "bangla" in Hindi and Punjabi) which has now been converted to a gurudwara, now the gurudwara is called the Bangla Sahib to memorialise Guru Har Rai's stay here.</p>
    <p>
        The eighth Sikh Guru, Guru Har Krishan resided here during his stay in Delhi in 1664. During that time, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox">smallpox</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera">cholera</a> epidemic, and Guru Har Krishan Ji helped the suffering by giving aid and fresh water from the well at this house.
        Soon he too contracted the illness and eventually died on 30 March 1664. A small tank was later constructed by Raja Jai Singh over the well, its water is now revered as having healing properties and is taken by Sikhs throughout the world back to their homes.
