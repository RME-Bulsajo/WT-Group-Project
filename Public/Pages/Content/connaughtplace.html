    <h1>  CONNAUGHT PLACE </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
       Connaught Place, officially known as Rajiv Chowk, is one of the main financial, commercial and business centres in New Delhi, Delhi, India. It houses the headquarters of several noted Indian firms and is a major shopping, nightlife and tourist destination in New Delhi. As of July 2018, Connaught Place was the ninth most expensive office location in the world with an annual rent of $1,650 per square metre.
    </p>
    <h2> History </h2>
    <hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Skyline_at_Rajiv_Chowk.JPG/1920px-Skyline_at_Rajiv_Chowk.JPG" height="300px" width="400px" align="right">
    <p>
        Prior to the construction of Connaught Place, the area was a ridge, covered with kikar trees and populated with jackals and wild pigs. Residents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Gate,_Delhi">Kashmere Gate</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Lines">Civil Lines</a> area visited during the weekends for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partridge">partridge</a> hunting. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman_Temple,_Connaught_Place">Hanuman Temple</a> attracted many visitors from the old walled city, who came only on Tuesdays and Saturdays and before sunset, as the return trip was considered dangerous.
        <br><br>
        Residents of villages including Madhoganj, Jaisingh Pura and Raja ka Bazaar were evicted to clear the area for the construction of Connaught Place and the development of its nearby areas. The villages were once situated along the historic Qutb Road, the main road connecting Shahjahanabad, the walled city of Delhi (now known as Old Delhi) to Qutb Minar in South Delhi city since the Mughal era.

    <h3> Construction </h3>

        Plans to have a central business district were developed as the construction of the new capital of imperial India began to take shape. Headed by W.H. Nicholls, the chief architect to the Government of India, the plans featured a central plaza based on the European Renaissance and in the Classical style. However Nicholls left India in 1917, and with Lutyens and Baker busy working on larger buildings in the capital, design of the plaza eventually fell to Robert Tor Russell, chief architect to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Public_Works_Department">Public Works Department</a> (PWD), Government of India.

        Named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Arthur,_Duke_of_Connaught_and_Strathearn">Prince Arthur</a>, 1st Duke of Connaught (1850–1942), third son of Queen Victoria and uncle of King George VI of the United Kingdom, who visited India in 1921 and laid the foundation of the Council House (now Sansad Bhavan, or Parliament House). It was renamed to Rajiv Chowk in 2013, after former Prime Minister of India, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a>.

    <h3> Early years </h3>
    <p>

        Early commercial establishments belonged to traders from the Kashmere Gate area: Kanter's, Galgotia and Snowhite. Some of the other oldest and still existing establishments include Ram Chandra & Sons (since 1935), Novex (since 1937), Dhoomi Mal Gallery (since 1936), Vaish at Rivoli (since 1939), Indian Arts Palace (since 1935), Mahatta & Company (since 1947).
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the rulers of the Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state">princely states</a> had their local homes in the nearby areas around King's way (modern-day Rajpath), and would frequent shops for designer clothes, artefacts, shoes, and pianos. Regal cinema, the first cinema in Connaught Place, opened around this time and went on to host popular concerts, theatre groups, and ballet performances. The Odeon and Rivoli followed the Regal, while the Indian Talkie House opened in 1938.
    </p>
    <h3> Post-independence </h3>
    <p>
        Until the 1980s, a Phatphat Sewa, a Harley Davidson rickshaw service, took visitors from Connaught Place to the Red Fort and Chandani Chowk, before it was stopped due to pollution concerns. The empty block of the Inner Circle came into use in the late 1970s with the construction of an underground market, the first in Delhi, Palika Bazaar at the junction point. Stretching up to the Outer Circle, it also came with an adjoining underground parking lot. Also in the 1970s, the State Emporiums on Baba Karak Singh Marg radial emerged.

        After the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film">talkies</a> to Indian cinema in 1931, the new medium became a craze and in the 1930s and the 40s, four theatres opened within Connaught Place Plaza: Regal, Rivoli, Odeon and a short-lived "Indian Talkie House" that opened in 1938. Connaught Place became the entertainment hub of New Delhi. The Regal, the first theatre in the area, was opened in 1932 by Sir Sobha Singh. It was designed by architect Walter Sykes George and mainly hosted stage performances. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the coming years it hosted Western Classical music artists, Russian ballet and British theatre groups, and soon started morning and afternoon movie shows. The next theatre to be built was the Plaza in 1940, designed by Sir Robert Tor Russell, the architect of Connaught Place itself. It was owned by director and actor Sohrab Modi until the early 1950s. The Odeon was built in 1945 and had the city's second 70mm screen after the "Shiela Cinema" in Paharganj. The Rivoli, close to the Regal, was the smallest theatre in the area. Half a century later most of the theatres were still running, although most had changed ownership. The Plaza and Rivoli are now owned by a multiplex giant PVR Cinemas, while the Odeon is a joint venture with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Entertainment">Reliance Big Pictures</a>.

    <h2> Today </h2>

    <p>
        The area is instantly recognisable on any map of Delhi as a big circle in the middle with radial roads spreading out in all directions. Eight separate roads lead out from Connaught Places's inner circle, named Parliament Street and Radial Roads 1 through 7. Twelve different roads lead out from Connaught Circus, the outer ring. The best known of these is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janpath">Janpath</a>, the continuation of Radial Road 1.
    </p>
    <h3> Central Park </h3>
    <p>
        Connaught Place's central park has long been a venue for cultural events and is a popular hangout for locals. In 2005–06, it was rebuilt after the construction of the Delhi Metro station below it. That station, Rajiv Chowk, is the interchange for the Yellow and Blue lines of the Metro and one of the largest and busiest stations in the network.
    </p>
    <h3> National flag at Central Park </h3>
    <p>
        The first known Indian to hoist the tricolour flag at Connaught Place is Padma Shri Mir Mushtaq Ahmad, the first Chief Executive Councillor of Delhi. Prior to independence, when Connaught Place was considered the heart of imperial British India, he would hoist the tricolour at the bandstand in Central Park each year on 26 January. On 7 March 2014, the largest known Indian national tricolour at that time (now second largest) was hoisted at the centre of Central Park, measuring 90 by 60 feet (27 by 18 m). The pole on which it is hoisted measures 207 feet (63 m).

    <h2> Redevelopment Plans </h2>

    By the late 2020 Connaught Place had lost much of its old glory, although the charm of the market continued to attract foot traffic. As a part of its 'Return to Heritage Project', the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi_Municipal_Council">New Delhi Municipal Council</a> (NDMC) prepared a plan to revamp and redevelop this Delhi landmark. The plan included the provision of heritage sensitive signage, engineering improvements of roads, drainage sewerage, water supply and substations, development of a traffic management plan, provisions of street furniture including adequate parking, walkways etc. and enhancing the structural stability of all buildings including retrofitting for earthquake resistance. All these components have been identified based on studies conducted by various reputed agencies such as SPA, RITES, CMCCC and NTPAC, etc.
    <p>
        The redevelopment work was slated to be completed in time for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Commonwealth_Games">2010 Commonwealth Games</a> held at Delhi, but due to huge cost overruns and undue delays, this deadline was not met. The Performance Audit Report prepared by Controller and Auditor General, India, on the Commonwealth Games 2010 concluded that there were "significant deficiencies in contract management, with consequent avoidable expenditure".
