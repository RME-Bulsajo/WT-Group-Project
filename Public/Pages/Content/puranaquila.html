<h4>History of Purana Qila, Delhi</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>You may end up getting confused if you go through the history books for checking out the history of Purana Qila. Popular belief is that the qila was built on the historical site of Indraprastha by Humayun and Sher Shah Suri. However, it is difficult to discriminate between their works as it is more or less similar.
    
    The common belief is that the walls and gates were built under the guidance of Humayun, while the buildings within the qila including the mosque and the Sher Mandal, have been built by Sher Shah Suri. In nutshell, it is believed that Humayun had rebuilt Indraprashtha and had named it Dinpanah, while Sher Shah improved the citadel.
    
    Purana Qila is rectangular in shape and is spread over an area of 1.5 kilometers. The walls at the east and west side of the qila are the largest. Each wall of the qila is 0.33 meters thick and and is sealed by massive bastions at each end. Unlike the other forts of the city, the walls of Purana Qila are not provided with frequent bastions. It is only on the west wall that the frequency of bastions has been increased, with each bastion placed about 73 metres away from the other. This was probably because the qila was surrounded by water from the rest of the sides, leading to increased safety.
    
    The bastioned ramparts of the Purana Qila are an epitome of strength. These massive structures are created of rubber masonry. Another amazing feature of the Purana Qila are the three gates that are a display of a happy blend of Hindu and Muslim styles of architecture.
    
    The Northern gate, also known as Tallaqi Darwaza, is embellished of panels, showcasing a man engaged in a mortal combat with a lion. The Southern gate also has similar panels, where lion has been replaced by elephants. Of all the gates, Tallaqi Darwaza is the most famous, being almost 39 metres taller than the low lying ground.
    
    The roof of the Tallaqi Darwaza is crowned by three chattris, supported by columns of red stones. These chattris were painted in white, giving a dazzling effect and striking appearance.
    
    However, beyond the amazing beautiful walls of Purana Qila are the notable buildings placed inside the fort. The buildings, Sher Mandal and Qila-i-Kunha Masjid, have survived the onslaught of times and still stand tall.
    
    Sher mandal, the double-storeyed octagonal tower is associated with the death of Humayun. While climbing the stairs of the building, Humayun slipped and lost his life. The Qila-i-Kunha masjid, however, was built around 1541 AD. It is known to be an important landmark in the history Indo-Islamic architecture. The beauty of the building speaks volumes of the architecture might that Sher Shah Suri had. It has been aptly described as one of the most perfect buildings of Sher Shah Suri by Fergusson.
    The Qila-i-Kunha masjid has been inspired by Jamali Masjid, that was erected fifteen years earlier. However, Sher Shah’s creation marks some significant improvements. It is improved and amplified and showcases a well-balanced composition.
    The Qila-i-Kunha masjid is not too large, as it is built in an area of 51X13.5 metres. It is 20.1 metres tall and is built of a variety of materials. The entrance arch of the masjid is made up of marble, while the spandrels of are made up of Red Stones with marbles studded on to them. The columns and plasters have been kept of white and black marbles. The unique blending of various colourful stones gives a fair sense of architectural style that Sher Shah Suri endorsed.
    There is also a museum inside the Purana Qila that takes you back in time. The exhibits displayed in the museum include the real things that were used by the royals.
