    <h1> MAJNU KA TILA </h1>   
    <hr>
    <p>Majnu Ka Tilla (MKT) is the place for good, cheap food. Most of the restaurants are run by Tibetans, and while conversations can get difficult sometimes, the food is always amazing.

Located close to Delhi University’s North Campus, the place is populated with students, foreigners, and locals. We went to discover all the hidden food gems, and here’s what we found. Do keep in mind that none of the places serve non-veg on Wednesdays.

The closest metro station to this awesome food hub is Vishwavidyalaya. </p>

<h4>Coffee House</h4>

<p>Coffee House is the perfect place for dessert and breakfast. Their mud cake with ice cream, and banana muffins are to die for. They even serve pancakes, but only before 11am, and their desserts are home-made and fresh. They have a huge variety of beverages to choose from, but we preferred the hot ones over the cold. You can sit here for hours and they won’t mind, as long as you’ve ordered at least one item.
<br>
Price: INR 400 for two people.

<h4>Dolma House</h4>
<P>Buff lovers rejoice; Dolma House has a lot of options especially for you. This is a small but cosy space in MKT, and has a canteen-like vibe with its seating arrangements. We loved the veg balls on a stick with schezwan sauce (a dish even non-vegetarians will love) and the Dolma Special Chowmein. Avoid the Then thukhere (too watery), though do keep a lookout for their specials (listed near the cashier).
<br>
Price: INR 400 for two.

<h4>Ama Restaurant</h4>

<p>They serve one of the best thukpas we’ve ever eaten. Not to be confused with Ama Café, this restaurant is for those looking to have a proper meal in a well-maintained ambience in MKT. The service is slow and it’s one of the few places that doesn’t offer Wi-Fi, but the food more than makes up for it. Do try the Crispy Vegetables with Salt and Pepper and the momo.
<br>
Price: INR 600 for two people.

<h4>Kham Coffee House</h4>
<p>We love the cosy interiors and quintessential Tibetan atmosphere inside this café. We are totally nuts about their Almond and Carrot Cake and Lemon & Mint Mojito. If you’re in the mood for conversations, the owner of this café loves to chat about art and Tibet. We’ve heard that their pancakes are great, but they’re only served for breakfast.
<br>
Price: INR 400 for two people.

<h4>Dekhang Cafe And Restaurant</h4>
<p>This one and a half year old outlet is easily visible as it’s on the main road. It has one of the most diverse menus in MKT as it serves breakfast, coffee, Chinese and Tibetan food. Their cold coffee is very good and it’s one of the few places here that serves beer. Head to Dekhang if you’re not sure about what you want to eat and yet, want the best of what MKT has to offer in one sitting.

Price: INR 400 for two.

<h4>Busan Korean Restaurant</h4>
<p>Busan is known for its great Korean food. And, if you're trying it for the first time, then we recommend the Bibimbap. Their Pork Momos are a great option too. This eatery is actually known for its pork dishes, so maybe also give the Samgyeopsal a go. 
    <br>
Price: For two people, it'll cost you around INR 900. 
<br>
</p>

<h4>Tee-Dee</h4>

<p>Tee-Dee is a cute, warm and colorful place to gobble up great Tibetan food and chill with your friends. If you're looking to eat something non-vegetarian, try their Buff Chilli or Sliced Pork with Mushrooms with Egg Fried Rice and their Kothe. 
    <br>
Price: INR 200 for two people.
