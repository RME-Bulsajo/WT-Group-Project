        <p>The Teen Murti Bhavan is a splendid and historical architecture located in the Indian capital city of New Delhi. This magnificent structure was built in the year 1930 by British architect Robert Torr Russel as a part of the new capital city and served as the residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army. After Independence, it was converted into the residence of the Indian Prime Minister, who was Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru at that time. The Teen Murti Bhavan was his residence for 16 years until his death in 1964, after which the house was converted into a memorial dedicated to him. It is called so owing to the statue of three soldiers that exists in the premises of the Bhavan. In addition to being an important national memorial, Teen Murti Bhavan today houses various institutions like the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. Some parts of Nehru's old office have been recreated in the museum by using the same furniture and other artefacts that he used at that time, while the library has exhaustive resources on the modern history of India. The office of Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund is also situated within the bounds of the Bhavan. One of the four Nehru Planetariums is also located within the grounds of the house and is a place of keen interest for children and science enthusiasts alike. The planetarium hosts some really interesting shows and presentations in its sky theatre and is a must if you happen to visit this place.</p>
