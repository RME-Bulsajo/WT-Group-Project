        <p style = "text-align:center;" id="des"><i> - This article is about the Red Fort in Delhi. It is not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra_Fort">Red Fort of Agra</a> or

        <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [lalqila]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of 
        the Mughal Emperors. Emperor <strong>Shah Jahan</strong> commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital
        from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj 
        Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian
        traditions.</p>

        <p>The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble 
        structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely
        undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.
        </p>
        <p>On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong>, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on
        India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a 
        nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.
        </p>
        <span> Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the <strong>Red Fort Complex.</strong></span> <br>

        <p>Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. 
        Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also 
        constructed the Taj Mahal.The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. </p>
      
      
        <p>Construction began in the sacred Islamic month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 
        6 April 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh 
        Fort. The fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's 
        successor, <em>Aurangzeb</em>, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of 
        the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous.</p>

       <h2> Etymology </h2>
       <hr>
      The name Red Fort is a translation of the Hindustani Lāl Qila (Hindi: लाल क़िला, Urdu: لال قلعہ), deriving from its red sandstone walls.
       Lal was derived from Hindustani language meaning "Red" and Qilàh derived from Arabic word meaning "Fortress". As the residence of the 
       imperial family, the fort was originally known as the "Blessed Fort" (Qila-i-Mubārak). Agra Fort is also known as <strong>Lāl Qila.</strong>
