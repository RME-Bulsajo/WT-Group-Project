        Swaminarayan Akshardham is a Hindu temple, and spiritual-cultural campus in Delhi, India. The temple is close to the border with
         Noida. Also referred to as <strong>Akshardham Temple</strong> or Akshardham Delhi, the complex displays millennia of traditional and modern 
         Hindu culture, spirituality, and architecture. Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogiji_Maharaj">Yogiji Maharaj</a> and created by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, it was 
         constructed by <strong>BAPS</strong>.
    </p>

        The temple was officially opened on 6 November 2005 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam">Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manmohan_Singh">Manmohan Singh </a>,

It is entirely constructed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan">Rajasthani</a> pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu architectural guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it makes no use of ferrous metal. Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete.
