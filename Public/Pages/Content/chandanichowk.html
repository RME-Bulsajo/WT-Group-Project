<h1>  CHANDANI CHOWK  </h1>
<hr>
<p>Chandni Chowk is a world of its own! While the rest of Delhi is spurring up with new cafes and bars, 
the age-old restaurants and modest stalls/kiosks found at Chandni Chowk are just as precious. We took 
a spin of some of the most famous and least explored places in that part of town and here’s what we 
found! Also, some of the places might be closed given the current scenario, so make sure you check up on 
‘em before you plan on heading out. </p>
